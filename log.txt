Ex09 Selector Exercise Starter

! Not able to add a "border: 3px solid red;" to input in 'Make all inputs have a 3px red border'
  ? Is the border CSS working
    - test on another element
    X It works
  ? Google an example with input class
    - Add width and padding
    X Nothing is happening
  ? Is there a rule over-writing this one?
    - There is actually build-in default rules for input but it doesn't overwrite.
    - The Css code is present in the editor
  ? Google again, but more specific about checkboxes
    - It seems that it's not really relevant to edit the checkbox. Hoomans on Stackoverflow advise to use JS or to add a div before the checkbox.
    X That's not the way I want to do it, because I trust the course.
  ? Maybe it's a mistake in the exercise. Let's check the previous disclamer about errors
    - "Hi Everyone!
In the next lecture you'll be asked to "Make all inputs have a 3px red border", this should say "Make all inputs (except the checkboxes) have a 3px red border". Checkbox elements cannot be styled directly. If you're wondering how to style them, you can checkout this StackOverflow thread."
$ So I can't edit the f*cking checkbox, it was written as a disclamer before the exercise.
* Note to myself: READ THE TEXT. WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT.
